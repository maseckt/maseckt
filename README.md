<h4>Hi, my friends! ðŸ‘‹</h4>
<p>
  I am an aspiring programmer from Russia. I'm learning Java and sometimes take on writing bots for Discord on Disnake.<br>
  Right now mostly doing my plugin for spigot servers - mRPchat. For writing plugins I use the best IDE for Java - IntelliJ IDEA.<br>
  I have experience with Linux, but since it doesn't have the programs I need, I'm using Windows.
